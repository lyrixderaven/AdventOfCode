# AdventOfCode: Python

A few python scripts that solve the 2015 Advent of Code problems.

Will see if I get to update them all the way...

To run, pull repo, create a virtualenv:

```
  virtualenv .
```

and install the dependencies:

```
  bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Have fun, and sorry for the crappy code ;-)
